    - Multi-sheet JOIN operations across different sheets in the same workbook
    - Export functionality to XLSX format with table names automatically becoming sheet names
  - **XLSX streaming parser**: Memory-efficient processing using `excelize.Rows()` iterator
    - Eliminated double memory allocation for better performance
    - Added duplicate header validation for parity with CSV/TSV parsers

  - Replaced arithmetic-based column naming (`'A'+i`) with `excelize.CoordinatesToCellName()`
  - Now supports unlimited columns: 27th column becomes `AA`, 28th becomes `AB`, etc.
  - Proper error handling for coordinate generation failures
- **üîç Case-Insensitive File Detection**: Enhanced compression file detection
  - Made `isCompressedFile()` case-insensitive to match other file type detection functions

- **üßπ Code Quality**: Removed unused imports and improved code consistency
- **üîß Architecture**: Enhanced streaming architecture for better memory efficiency
- **üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling**: Improved error messages with more context and actionable information

### Breaking Changes
**‚ö†Ô∏è XLSX File Behavior Change**: 
- XLSX files now create **multiple tables** (one per sheet) instead of a single table
- Table names follow the `{filename}_{sheetname}` pattern (e.g., `sales_Q1`, `sales_Q2`)
- This enables full utilization of multi-sheet Excel workbooks but changes the table structure

### Migration Notes
For users upgrading from v0.3.x:
1. **XLSX files**: Expect multiple tables instead of one. Update queries to reference specific sheet tables.
2. **Streaming parsers**: XLSX streaming parsers now process only the first sheet. Use `Open`/`OpenContext` for multi-sheet support.
3. **Table names**: XLSX-derived table names now include sheet names. Update any hardcoded table references.
