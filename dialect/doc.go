// Package dialect translates SQL written in a non-SQLite dialect (MySQL,
// PostgreSQL, or GoogleSQL) into SQLite SQL so it can run against the SQLite
// engine that backs filesql. Storage is always SQLite; only the query text a
// caller supplies is translated.
//
// The translation is best-effort compatibility, not a full emulator. It handles
// three classes of input:
//
//   - Known incompatibilities that have a SQLite equivalent are rewritten (for
//     example MySQL's backtick identifiers become double-quoted identifiers, and
//     PostgreSQL's "expr::type" becomes "CAST(expr AS type)").
//   - Known constructs with no SQLite equivalent (QUALIFY, arrays, STRUCT
//     types, LATERAL, DISTINCT ON, PostgreSQL's set-returning functions,
//     MySQL's XOR, ...) are rejected with ErrUnsupportedSyntax so the caller
//     sees a clear error instead of a confusing engine message: an array
//     literal reached SQLite as identifier quoting and came back as "no such
//     column: 1,2,3", and generate_series as "no such table", each naming
//     something the query never wrote.
//   - Anything else is passed through unchanged and left to SQLite to accept or
//     reject.
//
// Function gaps (NOW, DATE_FORMAT, TO_CHAR, SPLIT_PART, SAFE_DIVIDE, DIV,
// WIDTH_BUCKET, ...) are
// filled by user-defined functions registered into the SQLite driver via
// RegisterFunctions rather than by rewriting the SQL.
//
// Arithmetic reaches the same helpers by the other route, rewriting the
// operator into a call, where a dialect disagrees with SQLite about the answer.
// Division disagrees twice over: MySQL and GoogleSQL divide two integers into a
// real where SQLite and PostgreSQL answer an integer, and a zero divisor raises
// in PostgreSQL and GoogleSQL where SQLite and MySQL answer NULL. So "/" is
// rewritten for all three dialects and the remainder for the two that raise,
// with GoogleSQL's SAFE_DIVIDE left as the way to ask for the NULL.
//
// Casts go through the same mechanism for a different reason. SQLite's own CAST
// applies type affinity, which is close enough to look right and different
// enough to be wrong: it truncates where the dialects round, and it coerces a
// value the target type cannot represent instead of rejecting it. Each dialect
// therefore rewrites CAST (and PostgreSQL's "::", and GoogleSQL's SAFE_CAST)
// into a helper that converts with that dialect's rules and returns
// ErrInvalidCast for a value it cannot represent.
//
// Lexing is per dialect, because what counts as a string, an identifier, a
// comment, or an escape differs between them: a double-quoted literal is a
// string in MySQL and an identifier in PostgreSQL, block comments nest in
// PostgreSQL and not elsewhere, and only some dialects decode an escape that
// names a character by its number. Reading a literal by the wrong dialect's
// rules is the worst kind of failure this package can have, because the
// translation succeeds and the query answers from a value the caller never
// wrote, so each of those rules is configured rather than assumed.
//
// The SQLite dialect is the identity translation: Translate returns the input
// unchanged.
